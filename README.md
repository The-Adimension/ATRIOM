# ATRIOM Collection

**Artifacts Transformation & Resources Interoperability in Machine Learning**

> A curated collection of proof-of-concept, pilot, and prototype implementations demonstrating MLOps innovations in healthcare applications and beyond.

## ü´Ä Overview

ATRIOM (Artifact Transformation & Resources Interoperability in Machine Learning) is inspired by the heart's atrial functions (ATRIUM + IO):

- **Reservoir Phase**: Gathering and storing ML artifacts with automated environment setup
- **Conduit Phase**: Building data pipelines and transforming resources for interoperability
- **Active Phase**: Training, analyzing, and generating resource-efficient outputs

Each artifact follows the DEITY Principles Framework:
- **D**ata: Transparent, diverse inputs
- **E**thics: Responsible AI governance
- **I**nformatics: Interpretable outputs
- **T**echnology: Adaptive solutions
- **Y**ou: Empowering both human and machine intelligence

## üìö Collection

| Artifact | Description | Domain | Status | Links |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|-------|
| [Gemma_3NCORE](./artifacts/Gemma_3NCORE) | Cross-architecture knowledge distillation from MedGemma to Gemma 3n for cardiac imaging | Healthcare/Cardiac Imaging | ‚úÖ Available | [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MyOKduhgarpjR5c_yfKBd0ydZka4SNYK) |

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Browse the Collection**: Explore the [artifacts directory](./artifacts) for available implementations
2. **Choose an Artifact**: Each artifact contains comprehensive documentation and setup instructions
3. **Follow Setup Guide**: Use the artifact-specific README for detailed instructions
4. **Apply DEITY Principles**: Ensure ethical AI development, especially for healthcare applications

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- GPU access (Google Colab A100 recommended for most artifacts)
- Hugging Face account (for model access)
- Appropriate dataset permissions
